# scMultiome-zebrafish
Notes on scATAC+RNAseq analysis specifically for zebrafish.

For now mostly aimed at analysis of 10X multiome data [https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression). Specific notes for working with zebrafish as the default analysis packages are usually oriented towards human and mouse samples.
